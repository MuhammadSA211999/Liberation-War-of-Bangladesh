                Although East Pakistan accounted for a slight majority of the country's population,[57] political power
                remained in the hands of West Pakistanis. Since a straightforward system of representation based on
                population would have concentrated political power in East Pakistan, the West Pakistani establishment
                came up with the "One Unit" scheme, where all of West Pakistan was considered one province. This was
                solely to counterbalance the East wing's votes.

                    PoWs in five months.[11] Further, as a gesture of goodwill, nearly 200 soldiers who were sought for
                    war
                    crimes by Bengalis were also pardoned by India.[113] The accord also gave back 13,000 km2 (5,019 sq
                    mi)
                    of land that Indian troops had seized in West Pakistan during the war, though India retained a few
                    strategic areas;[114] most notably Kargil (which would in turn again be the focal point for a war
                    between the two nations in 1999). This was done as a measure of promoting "lasting peace" and was
                    acknowledged by many observers as a sign of maturity by India. However, some in India[115] felt that
                    the
                    treaty had been too lenient to Bhutto, who had pleaded for leniency, arguing that the fragile
                    democracy
                    in Pakistan would crumble if the accord was perceived as being overly harsh by Pakistanis.</p>

                <p>East Pakistan was a Pakistani province established in 1955 by the One Unit Policy, renaming the
                    province
                    as such from East Bengal. Its land borders were with India and Burma, with a coastline on the Bay of
                    Bengal. East Pakistanis were popularly known as "Pakistani Bengalis"; to distinguish this region
                    from
                    India's state West Bengal (which is also known as "Indian Bengal"), East Pakistan was known as
                    "Pakistani Bengal".</p>

                    The Bangladeshi Declaration of Independence was broadcast from Chittagong by members of the Mukti
                    Bahiniâ€”the national liberation army formed by Bengali military, paramilitary and civilians. The East
                    Bengal Regiment and the East Pakistan Rifles played a crucial role in the resistance. Led by General
                    M.
                    A. G. Osmani and eleven sector commanders, the Bangladesh Forces waged a mass guerrilla war against

                    Pakistani military. They liberated numerous towns and cities in the initial months of the conflict.

                The Bay of Bengal is the northeastern part of the Indian Ocean, bounded on the west and northwest by
                India, on the north by Bangladesh, and on the east by Myanmar and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands of
                India. Its southern limit is a line between Sangaman Kanda, Sri Lanka and the north westernmost point of
                Sumatra, Indonesia. It is the largest water region called a bay in the world.
