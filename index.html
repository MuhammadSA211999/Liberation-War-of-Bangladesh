                Although East Pakistan accounted for a slight majority of the country's population,[57] political power
                remained in the hands of West Pakistanis. Since a straightforward system of representation based on
                population would have concentrated political power in East Pakistan, the West Pakistani establishment
                came up with the "One Unit" scheme, where all of West Pakistan was considered one province. This was
                solely to counterbalance the East wing's votes.
