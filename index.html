            <p class="eert">
                Although East Pakistan accounted for a slight majority of the country's population,[57] political power
                remained in the hands of West Pakistanis. Since a straightforward system of representation based on
                population would have concentrated political power in East Pakistan, the West Pakistani establishment
                came up with the "One Unit" scheme, where all of West Pakistan was considered one province. This was
                solely to counterbalance the East wing's votes.

            <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War">Indian Threated</a> all the PoWs in
                strict accordance with the Geneva Convention, rule 1925.[112] It released more than 93,000 Pakistani
                PoWs in five months.[11] Further, as a gesture of goodwill, nearly 200 soldiers who were sought for war
                crimes by Bengalis were also pardoned by India.[113] The accord also gave back 13,000 km2 (5,019 sq mi)
                of land that Indian troops had seized in West Pakistan during the war, though India retained a few
                strategic areas;[114] most notably Kargil (which would in turn again be the focal point for a war
                between the two nations in 1999). This was done as a measure of promoting "lasting peace" and was
                acknowledged by many observers as a sign of maturity by India. However, some in India[115] felt that the
                treaty had been too lenient to Bhutto, who had pleaded for leniency, arguing that the fragile democracy
                in Pakistan would crumble if the accord was perceived as being overly harsh by Pakistanis.</p>
