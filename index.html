                Although East Pakistan accounted for a slight majority of the country's population,[57] political power
                remained in the hands of West Pakistanis. Since a straightforward system of representation based on
                population would have concentrated political power in East Pakistan, the West Pakistani establishment
                came up with the "One Unit" scheme, where all of West Pakistan was considered one province. This was
                solely to counterbalance the East wing's votes.

                    PoWs in five months.[11] Further, as a gesture of goodwill, nearly 200 soldiers who were sought for
                    war
                    crimes by Bengalis were also pardoned by India.[113] The accord also gave back 13,000 km2 (5,019 sq
                    mi)
                    of land that Indian troops had seized in West Pakistan during the war, though India retained a few
                    strategic areas;[114] most notably Kargil (which would in turn again be the focal point for a war
                    between the two nations in 1999). This was done as a measure of promoting "lasting peace" and was
                    acknowledged by many observers as a sign of maturity by India. However, some in India[115] felt that
                    the
                    treaty had been too lenient to Bhutto, who had pleaded for leniency, arguing that the fragile
                    democracy
                    in Pakistan would crumble if the accord was perceived as being overly harsh by Pakistanis.</p>

                <p>East Pakistan was a Pakistani province established in 1955 by the One Unit Policy, renaming the
                    province
                    as such from East Bengal. Its land borders were with India and Burma, with a coastline on the Bay of
                    Bengal. East Pakistanis were popularly known as "Pakistani Bengalis"; to distinguish this region
                    from
                    India's state West Bengal (which is also known as "Indian Bengal"), East Pakistan was known as
                    "Pakistani Bengal".</p>
